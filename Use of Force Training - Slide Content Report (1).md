# Policy Statement

## Cape May Police Department Policy

It is the policy of the Cape May Police Department that officers hold the highest regard for the dignity and liberty of all persons and place minimal reliance upon the use of force and instead use de-escalation tactics to the extent possible under the circumstances.

This department respects and values the sanctity of human life and the application of deadly force is a measure to be employed only in the most extreme circumstances.

### Key Policy Elements:

*   Officers shall use only that degree of force that is **reasonable, necessary, and proportional** considering the totality of the circumstances
*   Officers must consider the subject's mental and physical condition
*   Officers must consider the nature of the offense
*   Officers must consider the level of resistance or threat known at the time

Officers whose actions are consistent with the law and the provisions of this policy will be strongly supported by the law enforcement community in any subsequent review of their conduct regarding the use of force.

# Core Principle One: Sanctity of Human Life

## The Sanctity of Human Life and Serving the Community

In serving the community, officers shall make every effort to preserve and protect human life and the safety of all persons. Officers shall also respect and uphold the dignity of all persons at all times in a non-discriminatory manner.

### Key Elements:

*   Every officer shall respect the sanctity of human life and the dignity of every person
*   Officers shall act to preserve every life, whenever possible
*   Officers shall avoid unnecessary injury to members of the public or themselves
*   A respectful and cooperative relationship with the community is essential for effective law enforcement
*   This relationship can be undermined when force is used unnecessarily or unequally

Non-Discrimination Requirement+

## Slide 5

Core Principle Two: Force as Last Resort

Force as a Last Resort and Duty to De-Escalate

Force shall only be used as a last resort when necessary to accomplish lawful objectives that cannot reasonably be achieved through verbal commands, critical decision making, tactical deployment or de-escalation techniques. Force shall never be used as a retaliatory or punitive measure.

Authorized Uses of Force:

*   Effectuating a lawful arrest or detention
*   Carrying out a lawful search
*   Overcoming resistance directed at the officer or others
*   Preventing physical harm to the officer or another person
*   Protecting the officer or third party from unlawful force
*   Preventing property damage or loss

Prohibited Uses of Force

Officers shall exhaust all other reasonable means to gain compliance before resorting to force, if feasible. If a safe alternative would achieve law enforcement's objective, force shall not be used.

## Slide 6

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Critical Decision-Making

## Critical Decision-Making Model

Critical decision-making and tactical deployment techniques include tactical communication and tactical positioning, such as strategic redeployment and time as a tactic.

### Critical Decision-Making Process:

*   Begin critical assessment and planning **prior to arriving** at the scene
*   Collect available information
*   Assess situations, threats, and risks
*   Identify options for conflict resolution
*   Determine the best course of action
*   Act, review and reassess the situation as it evolves

### Tactical Positioning

Making advantageous uses of position, distance, and cover to reduce the risk of injury to an officer and avoid or reduce the need to use force.

### Time as a Tactic

A method to avoid forcing an immediate resolution to a situation if it can be safely done, including establishing a zone of safety around a person that creates an opportunity for an assessment and action, when feasible, thereby decreasing the need to resort to force.

Strategic Redeployment+

## Slide 7

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# De-escalation Techniques

## What is De-escalation?

De-escalation is the action of communicating verbally or nonverbally in an attempt to reduce, stabilize, or eliminate the immediacy of a threat. De-escalation may also be used to create the time needed to allow the situation to resolve itself or to position additional resources to resolve the situation with the least amount of force necessary.

### Key De-escalation Techniques:

*   **Communication techniques** to calm an agitated subject (e.g., regulating tone and pitch, speaking slowly in a calm voice)
*   **Rational decision-making techniques**, such as ensuring that only one officer addresses the person while others remain detached as safety permits
*   **Active listening techniques**, such as sharing the officer\'s name, asking the subject their name, and exhibiting a genuine willingness to listen
*   **Slowing down the pace** of the incident by taking deep breaths, slowing speech, and applying strategic thinking
*   **Using calming gestures and facial expressions** (e.g., arms extended with palms out and avoiding angry expressions)
*   **Procedural-justice techniques**, such as explaining the officer\'s actions and responding to questions

# Special Considerations

## Factors Affecting Compliance

Officers should consider an individual's mental, physical, developmental, intellectual disability, or other conditions that affect the person's ability to communicate or comply.

### Factors to Consider:

*   Behavioral or mental health crisis
*   Drug interaction
*   Medical condition
*   Mental impairment
*   Physical limitation
*   Developmental disability, including autism spectrum disorder

*   Cognitive impairment or intellectual disability
*   Hearing loss or impairment
*   Communication disorder, including speech impairment
*   Language barrier
*   Visual impairment
*   Age (very young or elderly)

### Response Techniques:

*   Obtain information from available sources including family members, caregivers or others who know the individual
*   Decrease exposure to potential threats by moving to a safer position

Core Principle Three: Reasonable Force
Duty to Use Only Objectively Reasonable, Necessary, and Proportional Force
Officers shall use the least amount of force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional to safely achieve the legitimate law enforcement objective under the circumstances.
Key Considerations When Using Force:
*   Immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or the public
*   Conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer at the time
*   Officer and subject characteristics (e.g., age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level of exhaustion or fatigue)
*   Effects of drugs or alcohol on the subject
*   Mental state or capacity of the individual
*   Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices
Additional Force Considerations+
Important Note: Law enforcement encounters are never static and rapidly evolve. Officers must continuously assess the effectiveness, proportionality, and necessity of their actions, including their tactical positioning, in order to decrease the likelihood of force being needed.

## Slide 10

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Levels of Resistance

## Understanding Resistance Levels

The level of resistance that an officer encounters is a key factor in determining the appropriate amount of force that may be used in response. The less resistance an officer faces, the less force the officer should use.

### Resistance Categories:

#### Cooperative Person

A person who responds to and complies with an officer's directions.

**Appropriate Response:** Officers may rely on police presence and/or verbal control techniques, but should not use force.

#### Passive Resistor

A person who is non-compliant in that they fail to comply in a non-movement way with verbal or other direction from an officer.

**Appropriate Response:** Officers may rely on police presence, verbal control techniques, holding techniques, lifting/carrying, wrist locks and other manual pain compliance techniques. Greater force, such as strikes, punches, CEDs, or less lethal devices shall not be used.

#### Active Resistor

A person who is uncooperative, fails to comply with directions, and actively attempts to avoid physical control. This includes evasive movement, flailing arms, tensing arms, and flight.

**Appropriate Response:** In addition to options for passive resistors, officers may use physical strikes with hands or feet, OC spray or batons applied with non-impact pressure, and taking the person to the ground.

#### Threatening Assailant

A person who is threatening the use of force against an officer or another person, with or without a weapon, in an aggressive manner that may cause bodily injury.

**Appropriate Response:** Officers may use all types of force options other than deadly force, including striking with batons, less lethal ammunition, and CEDs. Force must be proportional to the threat faced.

#### Active Assailant

A person who is using or imminently threatening the use of force, with or without a weapon, in an aggressive manner that poses a substantial risk of causing bodily injury.

**Appropriate Response:** Officers have all force options available, though deadly force shall only be used as a last resort.

# Displaying a Firearm

## Special Requirements for Displaying Firearms

Unholstering or pointing a firearm are tactics that should be used with great caution. The presence of an officer\'s firearm, under the right circumstances, can discourage resistance and ensure officer safety without the need to resort to force.

### Guidelines for Displaying Firearms:

*   Unnecessarily or prematurely drawing a firearm could limit an officer\'s options in controlling a situation
*   It could create greater anxiety on the part of the public
*   It could result in an unwarranted or accidental discharge of the firearm

### Pointing a Firearm:

*   Officers can point a firearm at a person **only when** circumstances create a reasonable belief that it may be necessary to use deadly force
*   When the officer no longer reasonably believes that deadly force may be necessary, the officer shall, as soon as practicable, secure or holster the firearm
*   Pointing a firearm, though not a use of force, constitutes a seizure that must be reported as a Show of Force on the Attorney General\'s Use of Force Reporting Portal

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Positional Asphyxiation

## Understanding Positional Asphyxiation

Positional asphyxiation is insufficient intake of oxygen as a result of body position that interferes with the subject's ability to breathe. It can occur during the process of subduing and restraining a person by placing the person in a posture that prevents or impedes the mechanism of normal breathing.

### Risk Factors:

*   Alcohol or drug intoxication
*   Possible mental health episode or incident
*   A substantially overweight individual
*   Possible suffering or respiratory muscle fatigue (exhaustion)
*   Possible airway obstruction
*   Unconsciousness

### Warning Signs:

*   Verbal complaints of being unable to breathe properly
*   Visual signs of struggling or increased effort to breathe
*   Gurgling/gasping sounds with foam or mucus from nose or mouth
*   Heightened aggression during restraint (fighting for air)
*   Sudden behavioral changes (violent to quiet, or suddenly more aggressive)
*   Blue discoloration of facial skin (cyanosis)

Required Actions to Reduce Risk+

**Critical Warning:** If the person cannot escape from the position, death may occur very rapidly. Restraint in the prone position presents a significant risk of asphyxia, particularly when a person is handcuffed and left in a face-down position.

## Slide 13

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Core Principle Four: Deadly Force as Last Resort

## Duty to Use Deadly Force Only as an Absolute Last Resort

Deadly force shall only be used as an absolute last resort and in strict compliance with department policy. Other actions by law enforcement that create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury must be avoided or employed only under the strictest of conditions.

### What Constitutes Deadly Force:

*   Force that an officer uses with the purpose of causing, or that a reasonable officer knows creates a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily injury
*   Discharging a firearm constitutes deadly force, unless during training, target practice, lawful animal hunt, or humane killing of an injured animal
*   A threat to cause death or serious bodily injury by the display of a weapon, so long as the officer\'s purpose is limited to creating an apprehension that deadly force will be used if necessary, does not constitute deadly force

### Types of Deadly Force Include:

*   Applying a chokehold, carotid artery restraint, or similar technique that involves pressure on the neck
*   Sitting, kneeling, or standing on a person\'s chest, back, or neck for a prolonged period of time
*   Intentionally driving a vehicle at or in the direction of a person with the intent to strike the individual
*   Using a baton or other weapon to intentionally strike an individual in the head or neck area

# Prohibited Uses of Deadly Force

## Specific Prohibited Circumstances

There are specific circumstances in which the use of deadly force is prohibited. Officers may not discharge their weapons or use other deadly force in the following situations:

### Deadly Force is Prohibited:

*   To signal for help
*   To issue a warning shot
*   To prevent property damage or loss
*   To prevent the destruction of evidence
*   Against a person who poses a threat only to themselves and not to others

Fleeing Suspects+

### Deadly Force Against Individuals in Moving Vehicles:

*   Officers shall never intentionally position themselves in the path of a moving vehicle or a vehicle that is likely to move
*   Officers shall make every effort to move out of the path of a vehicle to maintain their safety
*   Officers shall not grab onto moving vehicles or the drivers or occupants of moving vehicles
*   If a vehicle begins to move while an officer is engaged with the driver or an occupant, the officer shall, if feasible, disengage from the contact

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Surrendering a Weapon

## Weapon Surrender Policy

An officer shall not surrender their weapon unless it is the only alternative and only after the officer has used every tactical tool at the officer\'s disposal to avoid surrendering their weapon.

### Critical Safety Considerations:

*   Surrender of a weapon rarely de-escalates a serious incident
*   Surrendering a weapon will put the officer and innocent persons in jeopardy
*   Once a weapon is surrendered, the officer loses control of the situation
*   A surrendered weapon can be used against the officer or others

### Alternative Approaches:

*   Maintain tactical positioning and distance
*   Use available cover and concealment
*   Request backup when possible
*   Utilize de-escalation techniques
*   Consider tactical retreat if it can be done safely

Module 1 Summary: Core Principles+

**Remember:** The primary duty of all law enforcement officers is to preserve human life. Only when no other means are available should an officer consider surrendering their weapon.

## Slide 18

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Types of Force

## Force Classifications

The Cape May Police Department categorizes force into distinct types, each with specific applications, limitations, and reporting requirements.

### Physical Contact

Routine or procedural contact with a subject necessary to effectively accomplish a legitimate law enforcement objective.

*   Guiding a subject into a police vehicle
*   Holding the subject's arm while transporting
*   Routinely handcuffing a subject
*   Maneuvering or securing a subject for a frisk

_Note: Physical contact alone does not constitute force._

### Physical Force

Contact with a subject beyond that which is generally used to effect an arrest or other law enforcement objective.

*   Taking a resisting subject to the ground
*   Using wrist or arm locks
*   Striking the subject with the hands or feet

### Mechanical Force

The use of a device or substance, other than a firearm, to overcome a subject's resistance to the exertion of the officer's authority.

*   Use of a baton or other object
*   Oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray
*   Physical apprehension by canines

### Enhanced Mechanical Force

An intermediate force option between mechanical force and deadly force.

*   Conducted energy devices (CEDs)
*   Less-lethal devices and ammunition
*   Requires greater justification than physical/mechanical force
*   Lower justification than deadly force
*   Does not require imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury

### Deadly Force

Force that an officer uses with the purpose of causing, or that a reasonable officer knows creates a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily injury.

*   Discharging a firearm
*   Applying chokeholds or neck restraints
*   Strikes to the head or neck with impact weapons
*   Intentionally driving a vehicle at a person

Constructive Authority+

## Slide 19

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs)

## Understanding CEDs

A Conducted Energy Device (CED) means any device approved by the Attorney General that is capable of firing darts/electrodes that transmit an electrical charge or current intended to temporarily disable a person.

### Key CED Terminology:

*   **Cartridge:** A shell containing probes that penetrate the target and deliver neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI)
*   **Data Download:** The method of electronic recovery of the firing and video data saved by the CED upon activation
*   **Discharge:** To cause an electrical charge or current to be directed at a person in contact with the darts/electrodes
*   **Drive Stun Mode:** To discharge a CED when the main body of the device is in direct contact with the person against whom the charge or current is transmitted

*   **Fire:** To cause the darts/electrodes to be ejected from the main body of the device and to encounter a person for the purpose of transmitting an electrical charge
*   **Spark Display:** A non-contact demonstration of a CED\'s ability to discharge electricity that is done as an exercise of constructive authority to convince an individual to submit to custody

### Authorized Use of CEDs:

*   CEDs may be utilized against a Threatening Assailant or an Active Assailant
*   CEDs shall not be utilized against a passive resistor or an active resistor
*   When feasible, officers should warn the person that the officer intends to fire the weapon

# CED Safety Considerations

## Safety Protocols for CED Use

While CEDs are considered less-lethal devices, they still require careful consideration and adherence to safety protocols to minimize risks to subjects and officers.

### Environmental Safety Considerations:

*   A CED shall not be directed against a person who is situated on an elevated surface (e.g., a ledge, scaffold, near a precipice, etc.) unless reasonable efforts have been made to prevent or minimize a fall-related injury
*   A CED shall not be used in, on, or immediately adjacent to a body of water in which the targeted person could fall during any stage of the electrical current
*   A CED shall not be used in any environment when an officer knows or has reason to believe that a potentially flammable, volatile, or explosive material is present that might be ignited by an open spark

### Subject Vulnerability Considerations:

*   Officers must use particular care when considering whether to use a CED against an individual who is particularly vulnerable due to:
    *   Age (either elderly or young)
    *   Developmental disability
    *   Known or reasonably apparent medical condition (e.g., a pregnant female)

### Tactical Considerations:

*   To ensure officer safety, when feasible, at least one law enforcement officer other than the one deploying the CED should be present
*   The second officer should be armed with lethal ammunition and be prepared to utilize deadly force if the use of a CED fails
*   Deadly force would only be authorized in this situation as a last resort, if otherwise permitted by department policy
*   During the deployment of a CED, the deploying officer shall, when feasible, continually evaluate the options selected against changing circumstances
*   Officers trained and authorized to carry a CED shall be aware of and comply with any targeting recommendations made by the manufacturer

## Slide 21

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Less-Lethal Devices and Ammunition

## Understanding Less-Lethal Options

Less-lethal devices and ammunition provide officers with additional force options that are designed to temporarily incapacitate a subject without causing death or serious injury.

### Definitions:

#### Less-Lethal Ammunition

Ammunition approved by the Attorney General that is designed to stun, temporarily incapacitate or cause temporary discomfort to a person without penetrating the person's body.

*   Designed for single target, specific engagement
*   Must be used from a minimum standoff distance as prescribed by the manufacturer
*   Maximum effective distance/range shall not exceed the manufacturer's specifications

#### Less-Lethal Device

Any less-lethal weapon that is reviewed by the Attorney General or the Attorney General's designee. The term does not include OC spray or batons.

*   12-gauge shotgun
*   37mm or 40mm smooth or rifled bore launching system
*   Paintball type device with a bore diameter between .68-.691 inch

### Authorized Use of Less-Lethal Devices:

*   An officer may fire or discharge a less-lethal device during an actual operation, only against:
    *   An active assailant
    *   A threatening assailant who will not voluntarily submit to custody after given a reasonable opportunity
    *   A person attempting to cause death or serious bodily injury to themselves
    *   A fleeing suspect if clear and convincing evidence exists to believe the suspect has committed a crime causing or attempting to cause death or serious bodily injury

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Mechanical Force Options

## Understanding Mechanical Force

Mechanical force involves the use of a device or substance, other than a firearm, to overcome a subject's resistance to the exertion of the officer's authority. Common mechanical force options include batons and OC spray.

### Tactical Batons

*   Batons are defensive impact tools that may be used when the justification for the use of mechanical force exists
*   Batons shall only be used as instructed
*   Once resistance ceases, the use of the baton as a striking tool shall cease
*   Officers must exercise special care in their use and avoid striking potentially fatal areas of the body identified during training except when deadly force is otherwise authorized

Baton Safety Considerations+

### Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray

*   OC is permitted when the use of mechanical force is necessary and justified to apprehend or control an individual
*   The use of OC will facilitate the arrest with the minimum chance of injury to the officer, the arrestee, or innocent bystander
*   OC should be sprayed directly into the target's face with the spray being directed to the eyes, nose, and mouth from as close as safely possible
*   OC should always be used in accordance with manufacturers recommendations with short one-half to one-second bursts

OC Spray Restrictions+

# Key Definitions: Bodily Injury and Serious Bodily Injury

## Understanding Injury Classifications

The distinction between bodily injury and serious bodily injury is critical in use of force decision-making, as it affects the level of force that may be justified in a given situation.

### Bodily Injury

Physical pain or temporary disfigurement, or any impairment of physical condition.

_Bodily harm and bodily injury have the same definition for the purposes of department policy._

**Legal Reference:** N.J.S.A. 2C:11-1(a); N.J.S.A. 2C:3-11(e)

#### Examples of Bodily Injury:

*   Bruises
*   Minor cuts or abrasions
*   Sprains
*   Temporary pain without lasting effects
*   Minor swelling
*   Temporary limitation of movement

### Serious Bodily Injury

Bodily injury which creates a substantial risk of death or which causes serious, permanent disfigurement or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.

_Serious bodily injury and serious bodily harm have the same definition for the purposes of department policy._

**Legal Reference:** N.J.S.A. 2C:11-1(b); N.J.S.A. 2C:3-11(d)

#### Examples of Serious Bodily Injury:

*   Injuries creating substantial risk of death
*   Significant or permanent disfigurement
*   Dismemberment
*   Significant bone fractures
*   Loss of consciousness
*   Protracted loss or impairment of function of any bodily member or organ
*   Significant internal injuries

Importance in Use of Force Decisions+

**Critical Distinction:** Understanding the difference between bodily injury and serious bodily injury helps officers make appropriate decisions about the level of force that is reasonable, necessary, and proportional in a given situation.

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Key Definitions: Imminent Danger

## Understanding Imminent Danger

Imminent danger is a critical concept in use of force decision-making, particularly when considering the use of deadly force or enhanced mechanical force.

### Definition of Imminent Danger

Threatened actions or outcomes that are immediately likely to occur during an encounter absent action by the officer.

The period of time involved is dependent on the circumstances and facts evident in each situation and is not the same in all situations.

The threatened harm does not have to be instantaneous, for example, imminent danger may be present even if a subject is not at that instant pointing a weapon at the officer, but is carrying a weapon and running for cover to gain a tactical advantage.

### Key Characteristics of Imminent Danger:

*   **Immediacy:** The threat is about to happen or is in the process of happening
*   **Capability:** The subject has the means to carry out the threatened harm
*   **Opportunity:** The subject is in a position to carry out the threatened harm
*   **Intent:** The subject's actions or words indicate a willingness to cause harm
*   **Jeopardy:** The officer or another person is at risk of death or serious bodily injury

### Examples of Imminent Danger:

*   A subject pointing a firearm at an officer or another person
*   A subject reaching for a weapon while making threats
*   A subject charging at an officer with a knife or other dangerous weapon
*   A subject carrying a weapon and moving to a position of tactical advantage
*   A subject attempting to gain control of an officer's firearm

### Imminent vs. Immediate:

Imminent danger does not necessarily mean that the threat is instantaneous or immediate:

*   **Immediate** means happening right now, with no delay
*   **Imminent** means about to happen, impending, or threatening to occur
*   A threat can be imminent even if it is not immediate
*   Officers must assess the totality of circumstances to determine if danger is imminent

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Key Definitions: Feasible and Proportional Force

## Understanding Feasibility and Proportionality

The concepts of feasibility and proportional force are essential components of the Cape May Police Department's use of force policy, guiding officers in making appropriate decisions about when and how to use force.

### Feasible

Reasonably capable of being accomplished or carried out, given the totality of the circumstances, in a manner that maintains the safety of the public and officers.

#### Key Aspects of Feasibility:

*   What is feasible in one situation may not be feasible in another
*   Feasibility depends on the totality of the circumstances
*   Time constraints may impact what is feasible
*   Available resources affect feasibility
*   Officer safety considerations must be taken into account
*   Public safety must be maintained

#### Examples of Feasibility Considerations:

*   Is it feasible to issue a warning before using force?
*   Is it feasible to use de-escalation techniques?
*   Is it feasible to use less-lethal options?
*   Is it feasible to wait for backup or specialized resources?

### Proportional Force

The minimum amount of force, of both type (e.g., physical, mechanical, enhanced mechanical, or deadly) and intensity, that is necessary to control a situation and achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective.

#### Key Aspects of Proportional Force:

*   The law permits officers to overcome unlawful force or resistance
*   Proportional force is not intended to mean a type and intensity of force that is exactly equal to the type and intensity of force being used by the subject
*   The level of force utilized shall be no more than is necessary to overcome the unlawful force or resistance being confronted by the officer
*   As the subject's resistance decreases, the officer's use of force must also decrease

#### Examples of Proportional Force:

*   Using physical control techniques against a passive resistor
*   Using OC spray against an active resistor
*   Using a CED against a threatening assailant
*   Using deadly force only as a last resort against an active assailant posing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury

Relationship Between Feasibility and Proportionality+

**Remember:** Officers shall use the least amount of force that is objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional to safely achieve the legitimate law enforcement objective under the circumstances.

## Slide 27

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Key Definitions: Reasonable Belief

## Understanding Reasonable Belief

Reasonable belief is a foundational concept in use of force decision-making, serving as the standard by which officer actions are evaluated.

### Definition of Reasonable Belief

A reasonable belief is an objective assessment based upon an evaluation of how a reasonable officer with comparable training and experience would react to, or draw inferences from, the facts and circumstances confronting and known by the officer at the scene.

### Key Elements of Reasonable Belief:

*   **Objective Standard:** Based on what a reasonable officer would do, not what the individual officer subjectively believed
*   **Comparable Training and Experience:** Takes into account the level of training and experience of the officer
*   **Facts and Circumstances Known at the Time:** Based only on what the officer knew at the time, not information learned later
*   **Totality of Circumstances:** Considers all relevant factors present in the situation

### Factors Affecting Reasonable Belief:

*   Immediacy and severity of the threat
*   Subject\'s actions and behavior
*   Officer\'s perception of the subject\'s intentions
*   Subject\'s proximity to weapons
*   Environmental conditions (lighting, weather, terrain)
*   Number of subjects vs. number of officers
*   Size, age, and physical capabilities of the subject compared to the officer

# Prohibited Techniques: Chokeholds

## Understanding Prohibited Neck Restraints

Chokeholds and similar neck restraint techniques are classified as deadly force and are prohibited except in extraordinary circumstances when the officer\'s life is in danger and deadly force is authorized.

### Definition of Chokehold

A technique that involves applying direct pressure to a person\'s trachea (windpipe) or airway (front of the neck) with the effect of reducing the intake of air.

This includes a carotid restraint or any lateral neck restraint, where direct pressure is applied to the carotid artery restricting the flow of blood to the brain causing temporary loss of consciousness.

### Types of Prohibited Neck Restraints:

*   **Respiratory Restraints (Chokeholds):** Apply pressure to the trachea or windpipe, restricting airflow to the lungs
*   **Vascular Restraints (Carotid Restraints):** Apply pressure to the carotid arteries on the sides of the neck, restricting blood flow to the brain
*   **Lateral Neck Restraints:** Apply pressure to the sides of the neck, potentially affecting both breathing and blood flow

### Additional Prohibited Actions:

*   Sitting, kneeling, or standing on a person\'s chest, back, or neck for a prolonged period of time
*   Using a chokehold to prevent the destruction of evidence by ingestion

### Dangers of Neck Restraints:

*   Can cause death or serious bodily injury
*   May lead to unconsciousness within seconds
*   Can cause damage to the trachea, larynx, or cervical spine
*   May trigger cardiac arrest or stroke
*   Particularly dangerous for individuals with pre-existing medical conditions
*   Difficult to apply with precision in dynamic situations
*   Effects can be unpredictable and vary between individuals

Extraordinary Circumstances Exception+

Legal and Policy Context+

**Critical Warning:** Under no circumstances shall an officer use a chokehold, or any lesser contact with the neck area, in order to prevent the destruction of evidence by ingestion.

# Crowd Management Considerations

## Use of Force in Crowd Situations

The Cape May Police Department has specific restrictions and limitations on the use of force during peaceful demonstrations and civil disturbances. These guidelines help ensure appropriate responses while respecting constitutional rights.

### Key Definitions:

#### Peaceful Demonstration

A nonviolent assembly of persons organized primarily to engage in free speech activity. These may be scheduled events that allow for law enforcement planning or spontaneous. They include, but are not limited to, marches, protests, and other assemblies intended to attract attention.

#### Civil Disturbance

An assembly of persons engaged in or creating an immediate threat of collective violence, destruction of property, looting, or other criminal acts. Such a gathering may also be referred to as a riot.

### General Requirements:

Prior to using force against people in a crowd, officers shall:

*   Provide clear instructions and warnings in a manner that can be heard by persons in the crowd, such as through a bullhorn or speaker system when available
*   State the consequences of refusing to comply with a mandatory directive, including that arrests will occur and force may be used unless persons comply
*   Give a reasonable opportunity to comply

#### Peaceful Demonstrations

**Force shall not be used against crowds engaged in peaceful demonstrations.**

The visible presence or deployment of canines for crowd control purposes is prohibited in peaceful demonstrations. Canines may be used for explosive detection or similar security sweeps at such gatherings.

### Force Restrictions in Crowd Situations:

#### OC Spray

*   May be used against specific individuals who are active resistors, threatening assailants or active assailants
*   Shall not be used where bystanders would be unreasonably affected
*   Shall not be used against passive resistors, or indiscriminately against groups of people

#### CEDs

*   May be used against specific individuals who are threatening assailants or active assailants
*   May be used only when the individual can be accurately targeted
*   Shall never be fired indiscriminately into crowds

#### Less-lethal Ammunition

*   May be used during civil disturbances only against specific individuals who are threatening or active assailants
*   Shall not be used during a civil disturbance against groups of individuals

High-volume OC Delivery Systems+

**Important Note:** Force may be used against specific individuals in a crowd for lawful purposes in accordance with the other provisions of the Use of Force Policy. The focus should always be on addressing specific unlawful behavior rather than taking action against an entire crowd.

# De-escalation Techniques in Practice

## Applying De-escalation Effectively

De-escalation is the action of communicating verbally or nonverbally to reduce, stabilize, or eliminate the immediacy of a threat. When properly applied, these techniques can prevent the need to use force or reduce the level of force necessary.

### Communication Techniques:

*   **Tone and Pitch Control:** Speak slowly in a calm, measured voice
*   **Simple Commands:** Use clear, concise language
*   **One Officer Speaking:** Designate a single officer as the communicator
*   **Active Listening:** Show genuine interest in the subject\'s concerns
*   **Introduce Yourself:** "My name is Officer \[Name\]. I\'m here to help."
*   **Explain Actions:** "I\'m doing this because..."
*   **Offer Options:** Present choices rather than ultimatums when possible

### Non-verbal Techniques:

*   **Calming Gestures:** Arms extended with palms out
*   **Facial Expressions:** Avoid angry or threatening expressions
*   **Body Positioning:** Non-threatening stance, avoid "squaring up"
*   **Personal Space:** Maintain appropriate distance
*   **Eye Contact:** Maintain respectful eye contact without staring

### Tactical Approaches:

*   **Slow Down:** Take deep breaths, slow your speech, apply strategic thinking
*   **Create Distance:** Increase space to create time for decision-making
*   **Use Cover:** Position yourself behind protective barriers when available
*   **Request Resources:** Call for specialized units (CIT, negotiators, mental health professionals)
*   **Containment:** Keep the non-compliant person confined to a limited area
*   **Reduce Stimuli:** Eliminate or reduce sensory distractions (lights, sirens, noise)
*   **Time as a Tactic:** Use time to your advantage to calm the situation

#### The "LEAPS" Model:

*   **L**isten - Give your full attention to what the person is saying
*   **E**mpathize - Try to see the situation from their perspective
*   **A**sk - Ask open-ended questions to gather information
*   **P**araphrase - Repeat back what you heard to confirm understanding
*   **S**ummarize - Bring together the key points of the conversation

De-escalation Scenario Examples+

**Remember:** Officers should not default to attempting to resolve the incident immediately if slowing down the pace is viable and can be accomplished without creating an immediate threat to the public or placing officers in unreasonable danger.

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Critical Decision-Making Model Application

## Applying the Critical Decision-Making Model

The Critical Decision-Making Model (CDM) is an organized way of making decisions about how an officer will act in any situation, including those that may involve potential uses of force.

Ethics  
Values  
Sanctity of Life

1\. Collect Information

2\. Assess Threats & Risks

3\. Consider Authority & Limitations

4\. Identify Options & Determine Best Course

5\. Act, Review, and Reassess

### Step 1: Collect Information

*   Begin critical assessment and planning prior to arriving at the scene
*   Gather information from dispatch, witnesses, and observations
*   Consider what is known and what is unknown
*   Identify potential resources needed (backup, specialized units)

### Step 2: Assess Threats and Risks

*   Evaluate the nature and immediacy of any threats
*   Consider risks to the public, officers, and the subject
*   Assess the subject\'s actions, behavior, and apparent intentions
*   Look for indicators of weapons or dangerous conditions

### Step 3: Consider Authority and Limitations

*   Identify legal authority and jurisdiction
*   Consider department policies and procedures
*   Recognize constitutional limitations
*   Assess available resources and their capabilities

### Step 4: Identify Options and Determine Best Course

*   Consider all available options (from presence to deadly force)
*   Evaluate each option\'s potential effectiveness and consequences
*   Select the option that best addresses the situation with minimal force
*   Develop contingency plans if the selected option fails

### Step 5: Act, Review, and Reassess

*   Implement the selected course of action
*   Continuously monitor the results and effectiveness
*   Adjust approach as the situation evolves
*   Return to Step 1 as needed with new information

CDM in Practice: Scenario Example+

**Remember:** The CDM is not linear—it\'s a continuous process. Officers should constantly reassess as new information becomes available and conditions change. The core values of ethics, professionalism, and the sanctity of human life should guide every decision.

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Force Continuum Implementation

## Applying the Force Continuum in Real Situations

The force continuum provides a framework for officers to select the appropriate level of force based on the subject\'s behavior. Proper implementation requires continuous assessment and adjustment as the situation evolves.

### Key Implementation Principles:

*   **Dynamic Assessment:** Continuously evaluate the subject\'s behavior and level of resistance
*   **Proportional Response:** Match your force response to the level of resistance encountered
*   **De-escalation:** Reduce force as resistance decreases
*   **Communication:** Maintain verbal commands throughout the encounter
*   **Documentation:** Record all force used and the justification for each level

### Force Response Matrix

| Subject Behavior | Appropriate Force Response | Practical Application |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cooperative Person** Complies with verbal commands | Officer Presence Verbal Commands No physical force | • Professional appearance • Clear, respectful communication • Active listening |
| **Passive Resistor** Non-compliant in a non-movement way | Verbal Commands Physical Contact Soft Empty-Hand Control | • Firm verbal directions • Escort positions • Light guidance techniques • Pressure points |
| **Active Resistor** Actively attempts to avoid control | Physical Force Mechanical Force Pain Compliance | • Control holds • Joint manipulation • OC spray • Takedowns • Baton (non-impact pressure) |
| **Threatening Assailant** Threatens use of force that may cause bodily injury | Enhanced Mechanical Force Hard Empty-Hand Control Intermediate Weapons | • Conducted Energy Devices • Impact weapons (strikes) • Less-lethal munitions • Defensive strikes |
| **Active Assailant** Using or imminently threatening force that poses substantial risk | Deadly Force (Only as absolute last resort) | • Firearms • Strikes to vital areas • Any force likely to cause death or serious bodily injury |

### Transitioning Between Force Levels:

*   **Escalation:** Move to higher force level when lower level is ineffective or inappropriate for the threat level
*   **De-escalation:** Move to lower force level when resistance decreases or threat diminishes
*   **Verbal Commands:** Continue throughout all force levels
*   **Warning:** When feasible, warn before escalating force

### Common Implementation Errors:

*   **Force Matching:** Using the same level of force as the subject rather than the appropriate response
*   **Failure to De-escalate:** Not reducing force when resistance decreases
*   **Skipping Levels:** Moving to higher force level without attempting lower levels when feasible
*   **Emotional Response:** Allowing anger or fear to dictate force decisions rather than objective assessment

Scenario-Based Application+

**Remember:** The force continuum is not a rigid, step-by-step progression. It is a flexible framework that guides decision-making based on the totality of circumstances. Officers must continuously assess and adjust their force response as the situation evolves.

# Mental Health Considerations

## Special Considerations for Mental Health Crises

Encounters with individuals experiencing mental health crises require specialized approaches to de-escalation and force considerations. Officers must recognize signs of mental illness and adapt their response accordingly.

### Recognizing Mental Health Crisis:

*   Disorientation or confusion
*   Unusual or rapid speech patterns
*   Inappropriate emotional responses
*   Hallucinations or delusions
*   Paranoia or extreme suspicion
*   Impaired decision-making
*   Extreme agitation or withdrawal
*   Statements about suicide or self-harm
*   Bizarre or irrational behavior

### Communication Strategies:

*   Use simple, clear language
*   Speak slowly and calmly
*   Avoid threatening language or stances
*   Be patient and allow extra time for responses
*   Avoid arguing with delusions or hallucinations
*   Acknowledge feelings ("I can see you're upset")
*   Explain actions before taking them
*   Avoid multiple officers speaking at once

### Tactical Considerations:

*   Create distance and slow the pace of the encounter
*   Reduce environmental stimuli (lights, sirens, noise)
*   Request specialized resources (CIT officers, mental health professionals)
*   Consider whether force is necessary or if containment is sufficient
*   Be aware that pain compliance techniques may be less effective
*   Recognize that the person may not understand commands
*   Avoid unnecessary displays of force or authority
*   Use time as a tactic whenever possible

#### Excited Delirium Awareness

Excited delirium is a medical emergency that may present with:

*   Extreme agitation and aggression
*   Elevated body temperature/sweating
*   Unusual strength and endurance
*   Insensitivity to pain
*   Incoherent speech or shouting
*   Attraction to glass or bright objects

**Response:** Recognize as a medical emergency, request EMS early, minimize physical struggle, monitor breathing and positioning after restraint.

### Resources and Referrals:

#### Crisis Intervention Team (CIT)

Specially trained officers who can respond to mental health calls. Request CIT officers when available for mental health situations.

#### Mobile Crisis Teams

Mental health professionals who can respond to the scene. Available through dispatch in many jurisdictions.

#### Community Resources

Local mental health centers, crisis hotlines, and emergency psychiatric services that can provide follow-up care.

Legal Considerations+

Scenario Example+

**Remember:** The goal in mental health crisis situations is to resolve the encounter safely for all involved, connect the person with appropriate resources, and avoid unnecessary use of force or criminal charges when possible. Mental illness is a medical condition, not a crime.

## Slide 36

CMPD Use of Force Training

# Tactical Positioning and Communication

## Effective Positioning and Communication Strategies

Proper tactical positioning and communication techniques can significantly reduce the need for physical force by creating time and distance advantages that enhance officer safety and facilitate de-escalation.

### Tactical Positioning:

Making advantageous uses of position, distance, and cover to reduce the risk of injury and avoid or reduce the need to use force.

#### Key Positioning Principles:

*   **Contact/Cover:** One officer communicates while another maintains security
*   **Reactionary Gap:** Maintain 6-8 feet distance when possible
*   **Tactical L or V:** Position at angles rather than directly in front
*   **Triangulation:** Multiple officers position at different angles
*   **High Ground:** Position at elevation advantage when available
*   **Cover vs. Concealment:** Utilize physical barriers that stop bullets (cover) or hide position (concealment)

#### Strategic Redeployment

Repositioning by an officer to increase space and time to react to a subject. It includes gaining time to de-escalate by withdrawing from the immediate vicinity of the subject if doing so will not create a threat to the safety of the public or the officer.

### Tactical Communication:

Verbal communication techniques that are designed to avoid or minimize the use of force.

#### Key Communication Principles:

*   **Command Presence:** Professional appearance and demeanor
*   **Clear Instructions:** Simple, direct commands
*   **One Voice:** Single officer gives verbal commands
*   **Verbal Escalation:** Progress from conversational to command voice as needed
*   **Persuasion:** Explain benefits of compliance
*   **Active Listening:** Show genuine interest in subject's concerns

#### Time as a Tactic

A method to avoid forcing an immediate resolution to a situation if it can be safely done, including establishing a zone of safety around a person that creates an opportunity for assessment and action, thereby decreasing the need to resort to force.

### Tactical Scenarios and Positioning:

#### Traffic Stops

*   Offset position behind driver's door
*   Use vehicle as partial cover
*   Maintain awareness of passenger side
*   Consider lighting and visibility

#### Building Approaches

*   Avoid standing directly in doorways
*   Use threshold evaluation
*   Position at angles to entrances
*   Utilize cover when available

#### Subject Interactions

*   Maintain reactionary gap
*   Be aware of hands and waistband
*   Position at slight angle to subject
*   Keep tactical options open

Communication Models+

Tactical Considerations for Special Populations+

**Remember:** Proper tactical positioning and communication can prevent the need for physical force by creating time and space for de-escalation. Officers should continuously assess and adjust their positioning as the situation evolves to maintain tactical advantage and safety.

## Slide 37

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Defensive Tactics and Pain Compliance

## Proper Application of Control Techniques

Defensive tactics and pain compliance techniques are physical control methods that may be effective in controlling passive or active resistors. These techniques must be applied properly, with consideration for their effectiveness and potential for injury.

### Pain Compliance Guidelines:

Officers may only utilize pain compliance techniques that the officer has received department approved training on and only when the officer reasonably believes that the use of such a technique is necessary to further a legitimate law enforcement purpose.

### Factors to Consider:

*   Potential for injury to officer(s) or others if technique is not used
*   Potential risk of serious injury to the individual being controlled
*   Effectiveness of the technique in achieving appropriate control
*   Whether a different technique should be employed
*   Nature of the offense involved
*   Level of resistance of the individual(s)
*   Whether immediate resolution is necessary

#### Important Restrictions

*   Officers shall only use striking techniques directed at a subject's face as a means of self-defense, or in the defense of others
*   Striking at a subject's face using fists, elbows, knees and feet shall not be used as means of pain compliance
*   Pain compliance techniques shall be immediately discontinued once compliance has been achieved

### Common Pain Compliance Techniques:

*   **Joint Manipulation:** Applying pressure to joints in directions they are not designed to move
*   **Pressure Points:** Applying pressure to sensitive nerve clusters
*   **Wrist Locks:** Controlling movement through wrist manipulation
*   **Arm-Bars:** Leveraging the arm against its natural range of motion
*   **Come-Along Holds:** Techniques that use pain to guide movement
*   **Control Holds:** Positions that restrict movement through joint manipulation

### Effectiveness Considerations:

*   Pain compliance may be ineffective against subjects under the influence of drugs or alcohol
*   May be ineffective against subjects experiencing excited delirium
*   May be ineffective against subjects with high pain tolerance
*   May be ineffective against subjects experiencing mental health crisis
*   Environmental factors may limit application (weather, space constraints)

### Proper Application Principles:

#### Application

*   Apply techniques as trained
*   Use smooth, controlled movements
*   Apply minimum necessary pressure
*   Maintain proper body positioning
*   Use leverage rather than strength

#### Communication

*   Give clear commands
*   Explain what compliance looks like
*   Warn before increasing pressure
*   Acknowledge compliance immediately
*   Communicate with partners during application

#### Monitoring

*   Watch for signs of medical distress
*   Monitor breathing and circulation
*   Check for injuries after application
*   Adjust technique if ineffective
*   Discontinue immediately upon compliance

Transitioning Between Control Techniques+

After Control is Achieved+

**Important:** The application of any pain compliance technique shall be immediately discontinued once the officer determines that compliance has been achieved or other more appropriate alternatives can be reasonably utilized. Always be alert to the risks of positional asphyxiation during and after the application of control techniques.

# Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs)

## Operational Guidelines for CEDs

Conducted Energy Devices (CEDs) are enhanced mechanical force options that may be utilized against a Threatening Assailant or an Active Assailant. Proper training, deployment, and post-deployment procedures are essential for safe and effective use.

### Authorized Use:

An officer authorized to use a CED may fire, discharge, or utilize drive stun mode of the device during an actual operation, only against:

*   An active assailant
*   A threatening assailant who will not voluntarily submit to custody after having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so
*   A person who is attempting to cause death or serious bodily injury to themselves
*   A fleeing suspect, if clear and convincing evidence exists to believe the suspect has committed a crime in which the suspect caused or attempted to cause death or serious bodily injury

### Deployment Modes:

*   **Probe Mode:** Firing darts/electrodes that transmit electrical charge
*   **Drive Stun Mode:** Direct contact between device and subject
*   **Spark Display:** Non-contact demonstration (constructive authority)

### Prohibited Uses:

*   Against passive resistors or active resistors
*   For retaliation or punishment
*   To prevent property damage
*   Against operator of moving vehicle unless deadly force is authorized
*   In drive stun mode more than twice unless deadly force would be authorized
*   Multiple CEDs discharged upon a person at the same time
*   Against handcuffed subjects unless deadly force would be authorized and physical/mechanical force is not feasible

### High-Risk Situations:

*   Subjects on elevated surfaces
*   Near bodies of water
*   Near flammable materials
*   Vulnerable populations (elderly, young, pregnant, etc.)
*   Subjects exhibiting signs of excited delirium

### Deployment Procedures:

#### Before Deployment

*   Issue verbal warning when feasible
*   Ensure backup is present when possible
*   Have lethal cover available
*   Consider environmental factors
*   Evaluate subject factors (age, size, etc.)

#### During Deployment

*   Target preferred areas (below chest when possible)
*   Maintain safe distance
*   Limit exposure to 5-second cycles
*   Reassess after each cycle
*   Communicate with other officers

#### After Deployment

*   Secure subject promptly
*   Provide medical evaluation
*   Remove probes per training
*   Document deployment thoroughly
*   Preserve evidence (cartridge, probes, etc.)

Medical Considerations+

Documentation and Reporting+

**Remember:** CEDs are enhanced mechanical force options that should only be used when necessary and justified. Officers shall reevaluate the situation and reassess the need to use force before any second or subsequent firing or discharge against the same person.

## Slide 41

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Deadly Force Requirements

## Understanding Deadly Force Authorization

Deadly force shall only be used as an absolute last resort and in strict compliance with department policy. Officers must understand the specific requirements that must be met before deadly force may be used.

### Definition of Deadly Force

Force that an officer uses with the purpose of causing, or that a reasonable officer knows creates a substantial risk of causing, death or serious bodily injury. Discharging a firearm constitutes deadly force, unless the discharge occurred during the course of a law enforcement training exercise, routine target practice at a firing range, a lawful animal hunt, or the humane killing of an injured animal.

### Requirements to Use Deadly Force:

#### Imminent Danger Requirement

An officer may use deadly force only when the officer reasonably believes that such action is immediately necessary to protect the officer or another person from imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.

**Key Elements:**

*   Reasonable belief based on facts known at the time
*   Immediate necessity (no reasonable alternative)
*   Protection of officer or others (not property)
*   Imminent danger (about to occur, not speculative)
*   Death or serious bodily injury (not minor injury)

#### Procedural Requirements

*   **De-escalation:** When feasible, officers shall attempt to de-escalate situations, issue verbal warnings, or use non-lethal force with the goal of resolving encounters without using deadly force
*   **Alternatives:** Officers shall not use deadly force if a reasonably available alternative will avert or eliminate an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury and achieve the law enforcement purpose safely
*   **Warning:** When feasible, prior to using deadly force the officer shall identify themselves as a law enforcement officer and give a clear verbal warning that the officer will use deadly force
*   **Innocent Persons:** Officers shall not use deadly force when the use of deadly force creates a substantial risk of injury to innocent persons

### Types of Deadly Force:

*   **Firearms:** Discharging a firearm at a person
*   **Neck Restraints:** Applying a chokehold, carotid artery restraint, or similar technique that involves pressure on the neck
*   **Positional Asphyxia Risk:** Sitting, kneeling, or standing on a person\'s chest, back, or neck for a prolonged period of time
*   **Vehicle Tactics:** Intentionally driving a vehicle at or in the direction of a person with the intent to strike the individual
*   **Impact Weapons:** Using a baton or other weapon to intentionally strike an individual in the head or neck area

Fleeing Suspects+

Moving Vehicles+

**Critical Reminder:** Deadly force is an absolute last resort. Officers must exhaust all other reasonable means before resorting to deadly force. The decision to use deadly force must be based on the facts and circumstances known to the officer at the time, not on information learned later.

## Slide 42

# CMPD Use of Force Training

# Less-Lethal Devices and Ammunition

## Understanding Less-Lethal Force Options

Less-lethal devices and ammunition provide officers with enhanced mechanical force options that are designed to temporarily incapacitate a subject without causing death or serious bodily injury when properly deployed.

### Less-Lethal Ammunition:

Ammunition approved by the Attorney General that is designed to stun, temporarily incapacitate or cause temporary discomfort to a person without penetrating the person's body.

#### Approved Ammunition Types:

*   Impact projectiles (foam, rubber, or plastic)
*   Bean bag rounds
*   Baton rounds
*   Sponge grenades

#### Ammunition Requirements:

*   Designed for single target, specific engagement
*   Used from minimum standoff distance as prescribed by manufacturer

# OC Spray and Chemical Agents

## Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray

OC spray is a mechanical force option that uses capsaicin-based inflammatory agents to cause temporary discomfort and disorientation. When properly used, it can help officers control subjects with minimal risk of injury to all parties.

### Authorized Use:

OC is permitted in situations when the use of mechanical force is necessary and justified to:

*   Apprehend or control an individual
*   Overcome resistance directed at the officer or others
*   Protect the officer or third party from unlawful force
*   Prevent physical harm to the officer or another person

### Proper Application Technique:

*   Spray directly into the target's face
*   Direct spray to the eyes, nose, and mouth
*   Apply from as close as safely possible
*   Use short one-half to one-second bursts
*   Follow manufacturer's recommendations
*   Maintain safe distance to avoid contamination
*   Be aware of wind direction and environmental factors

### Prohibited Uses:

*   Against passive resistors
*   In the immediate vicinity of infants or the elderly unless necessary
*   On the operator of a motor vehicle unless the vehicle is first disabled (e.g., removal of keys from the ignition)
*   Where bystanders would be unreasonably affected
*   Indiscriminately against groups of people
*   For punishment or retaliation
*   After resistance ceases

### Physiological Effects:

*   Intense burning sensation on skin and mucous membranes
*   Involuntary eye closure and tearing
*   Inflammation of respiratory tract
*   Coughing and difficulty breathing
*   Disorientation and panic
*   Temporary loss of muscular coordination
*   Effects typically last 15-45 minutes

### Decontamination Procedures:

Following the use of OC, officers shall:

1.  Sit the subject upright as soon as practicable
2.  Expose the subject to fresh air as soon as possible and have them remain calm
3.  Have the subject flush the affected areas with large amounts of fresh water
4.  Read the department's Decontamination Statement to the exposed subject
5.  Do not apply salves, creams, oils, lotion, grease, or bandages to the exposed area
6.  Monitor for medical problems or difficulty that the exposed subject may experience
7.  Summon medical assistance if:
    *   The subject has medical problems
    *   Continues to have difficulty after decontamination procedures
    *   The subject requests medical treatment
    *   Inflammation or discomfort continues beyond 45 minutes
    *   The subject is wearing contact lenses

### High-Volume OC Delivery Systems:

#### Authorized Use

High-volume OC delivery systems are designed for, and may be used in, civil disturbances against groups of people engaged in unlawful acts resulting in, or creating an immediate risk of:

*   Bodily injury
*   Significant property damage
*   Looting
*   Other criminal acts

#### Deployment Considerations

*   Should only be deployed under specific command authority
*   Requires appropriate warnings to the crowd
*   Consider wind direction and environmental factors
*   Plan for decontamination of large groups
*   Ensure medical resources are available
*   Document justification thoroughly

Special Considerations+

Documentation Requirements+

**Remember:** Once resistance ceases, the further application of OC shall cease. Officers shall remain alert for medical problems or difficulty that the exposed subject may experience and monitor for positional asphyxiation.

# Impact Weapons and Techniques

## Tactical Batons and Impact Techniques

Impact weapons, primarily batons, are defensive tools that may be used when the justification for the use of mechanical force exists. These tools require proper training and technique to be used safely and effectively.

### Authorized Uses:

*   When mechanical force is necessary and justified
*   To overcome resistance directed at the officer or others
*   To protect the officer or third party from unlawful force
*   To prevent physical harm to the officer or another person
*   As a control device for non-impact pressure techniques

#### Critical Warning

Any strikes to the head or neck with a baton or asp are considered deadly force and can only be used when deadly force is allowed.

### Baton Techniques:

#### Control Techniques

*   Escort positions
*   Come-along holds
*   Joint locks using leverage
*   Pressure point applications
*   Non-impact pressure

#### Defensive Techniques

*   Blocks and deflections
*   Creating distance
*   Controlling space
*   Protective stances

#### Strike Techniques

*   Short strikes
*   Medium strikes
*   Long strikes
*   Jabs
*   Strikes to motor nerve points

### Key Guidelines:

*   Batons shall only be used as instructed in department-approved training
*   Once resistance ceases, the use of the baton as a striking tool shall cease
*   Officers must exercise special care and avoid striking potentially fatal areas of the body except when deadly force is authorized
*   If a baton is used, officers shall observe the affected subject for obvious changes in condition or breathing
*   Officers shall immediately summon medical assistance if the subject appears to need medical aid

Effectiveness Considerations+

Documentation Requirements+

**Remember:** Impact weapons are defensive tools. The primary goal is to gain control with minimal injury. Once control is achieved, the use of impact weapons must cease immediately.

# Reporting Requirements

## Core Principle Seven: Duty to Report and Review Uses of Force

Every use of force must be reported and receive a meaningful/administrative command level review as set forth in a written department policy that includes review by the law enforcement executive.

### Required Reports:

In all instances when law enforcement force is used, except when such force results in a fatality, all officers who employ such force shall complete and submit:

1.  **Electronic Use of Force Report** through the Attorney General's Use of Force Reporting Portal
    *   Whenever possible, complete prior to going off-duty
    *   If unable to complete within 24 hours, should be completed as soon as able or by a supervisor within 48 hours
    *   If force resulted in a fatality, only the Division of Criminal Justice or the County Prosecutor can authorize completion
2.  **Conducted Energy Device Deployment Review Report** (if a CED is used)
3.  **Investigation Report and/or Supplemental Report**
    *   Exception: Supervisors shall not require officers deploying force which results in death or serious bodily injury being investigated by the County Prosecutor's Office or Division of Criminal Justice to submit investigative reports
    *   Only the County Prosecutor's Office or the Division of Criminal Justice can order such reports

### Show of Force Reporting:

The following actions must be reported as a Show of Force in the Attorney General's reporting portal:

*   Pointing a firearm at another person
*   CED spark displays

**Exception:** An officer engaged in the operation of a tactical team shall be required to report the pointing of a firearm only when the pointing involves a sustained active engagement with a person in order to gain that person's compliance. A member of a tactical team who quickly "sweeps" a room during an operation need not report each person at whom a firearm was momentarily pointed during the sweep.

### Firearm Discharge Reporting:

In all instances whenever an officer discharges a firearm, CED, or less lethal device for other than training or recreational purposes:

*   Immediately report the discharge to the law enforcement agency where the discharge occurred
*   For on-duty officers, complete reports prior to the end of shift
*   For off-duty officers, complete reports as soon as possible after the incident
*   If an officer is incapacitated, a superior officer shall complete these reports
*   If discharge was due to an aggressive animal, an electronic Use of Force Report is required in addition to an Investigation Report

### CED-Specific Reporting:

Except when the use of a CED results in death, in instances when a CED is fired at or discharged upon a person:

*   A superior officer shall investigate the circumstances and outcome
*   A superior officer designated by the Chief shall prepare a report regarding the information stored in the device
*   Report must contain information related to the time the weapon was fired, the time of all electrical discharges, and BWC recordings
*   Information shall be preserved consistent with retention schedules
*   The superior officer shall forward the report to the Chief of Police
*   The Chief of Police shall issue a finding on whether the firing and discharges complied with policy
*   The Chief of Police shall forward the case report, CED data log(s), and any associated recording(s) to the County Prosecutor within 10 business days

### Notification Requirements:

*   Immediately notify the Chief of Police and the Cape May County Prosecutor's Office when:
    *   Use of force results in death or serious bodily injury
    *   Injury of any degree results from the use of a firearm
*   The internal affairs supervisor shall notify the County Prosecutor's Office within 24 hours of any firearms discharge
*   All firearms discharges shall be immediately reported to the Cape May County Prosecutor's Office (except recreation, training, qualification)
